# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to ketchup. It's people like you that make it such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Ketchup is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into ketchup itself.

# Ground Rules

Responsibilities

* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.

For larger contribution, refer to our [LICENSE](LICENSE) for intellectual property policy.

# How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email ketchup@vibioh.fr instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us.

When filing an issue, make sure to fill [appropriate template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md)

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in ketchup, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that ketchup has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage.

After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community

We try to follow [Conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) rules for writing good commit message.
